To create a structured course for learning Python programming with Python 3, PyCharm, and GitKraken installed, using a numbering system to identify each project, follow this comprehensive plan. The course is designed for beginners, starting with fundamental concepts and progressing to more advanced topics, with each project building on previous knowledge. Below is a detailed outline of the course, including setup instructions, project organization, and a sequence of numbered projects.

---

### 1. Setting Up the Environment
Before starting the course, ensure your tools are ready:

- **Python 3**: Verify that Python 3 is installed by running `python3 --version` (or `python --version` on Windows) in your terminal or command prompt. You should see a version number (e.g., Python 3.11.0).
- **PyCharm**: Use PyCharm as your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write, run, and debug your Python code. Download and install it from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) if not already installed.
- **GitKraken**: Use GitKraken for version control to track your progress. Install it from [GitKraken’s website](https://www.gitkraken.com/) and ensure it’s set up with a Git repository.

---

### 2. Course Structure
The course consists of a series of hands-on projects, each designed to teach specific Python programming concepts. Key features include:

- **Numbering System**: Projects are numbered sequentially (e.g., Project 1, Project 2, etc.) to reflect the learning progression.
- **Progressive Learning**: Each project introduces new concepts while reinforcing skills from previous projects.
- **Practical Focus**: Projects are engaging and practical, such as games or utilities, to make learning enjoyable.

---

### 3. Project Organization
To keep your work organized:

- **Create a Main Project Directory**:
  - In PyCharm, create a new project named `PythonCourse`.
  - This will serve as the root directory for all your course projects.

- **Subfolders for Each Project**:
  - Inside `PythonCourse`, create a separate folder for each project (e.g., `project1/`, `project2/`, etc.).
  - Each folder will contain the Python files (e.g., `main.py`) specific to that project.

- **Example Directory Structure**:
  ```
  PythonCourse/
  ├── project1/
  │   └── main.py
  ├── project2/
  │   └── main.py
  ├── project3/
  │   └── main.py
  └── ...
  ```

---

### 4. Version Control with GitKraken
Track your progress using Git:

- **Initialize a Git Repository**:
  - In PyCharm, go to `VCS > Enable Version Control Integration`, select Git, and click OK.
  - Alternatively, open GitKraken, select `File > Init Repo`, and choose the `PythonCourse` directory.

- **Commit After Each Project**:
  - After completing a project, commit your changes in GitKraken with a descriptive message (e.g., "Completed Project 1: Basic Calculator").
  - This allows you to track your progress and revert to previous versions if needed.

---

### 5. Sample Project Sequence
Below is a sequence of numbered projects, each with a specific objective and task. These projects are designed to teach core Python concepts progressively.

#### Project 1: Hello, World! and Basic Input/Output
- **Objective**: Get familiar with PyCharm and basic Python syntax.
- **Task**: Write a program that:
  1. Prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
  2. Asks the user for their name using `input()` and prints a personalized greeting (e.g., "Hello, Alice!").
- **Example Code**:
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  name = input("Enter your name: ")
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")
  ```
- **Folder**: `project1/`

#### Project 2: Simple Calculator
- **Objective**: Learn about variables, data types, and basic operations.
- **Task**: Create a program that:
  1. Asks the user for two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /).
  2. Performs the operation and displays the result.
- **Example Code**:
  ```python
  num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
  num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
  op = input("Enter operation (+, -, *, /): ")
  if op == '+':
      result = num1 + num2
  elif op == '-':
      result = num1 - num2
  elif op == '*':
      result = num1 * num2
  elif op == '/':
      result = num1 / num2
  print(f"Result: {result}")
  ```
- **Folder**: `project2/`

#### Project 3: Number Guessing Game
- **Objective**: Introduce control structures (loops and conditionals).
- **Task**: Implement a game where:
  1. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100 (use `random.randint(1, 100)`).
  2. The user guesses the number, receiving hints like "Too high" or "Too low" until they guess correctly.
- **Example Code**:
  ```python
  import random
  number = random.randint(1, 100)
  guess = 0
  while guess != number:
      guess = int(input("Guess a number (1-100): "))
      if guess < number:
          print("Too low!")
      elif guess > number:
          print("Too high!")
  print("Congratulations, you guessed it!")
  ```
- **Folder**: `project3/`

#### Project 4: Temperature Converter
- **Objective**: Learn about functions.
- **Task**: Write a program with two functions:
  1. `c_to_f(celsius)`: Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
  2. `f_to_c(fahrenheit)`: Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius.
  3. Ask the user for a temperature and conversion direction, then display the result.
- **Example Code**:
  ```python
  def c_to_f(celsius):
      return (celsius * 9/5) + 32
  def f_to_c(fahrenheit):
      return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9
  choice = input("Convert (C)elsius to Fahrenheit or (F)ahrenheit to Celsius? (C/F): ")
  if choice.upper() == 'C':
      temp = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))
      print(f"{temp}°C is {c_to_f(temp)}°F")
  else:
      temp = float(input("Enter temperature in Fahrenheit: "))
      print(f"{temp}°F is {f_to_c(temp)}°C")
  ```
- **Folder**: `project4/`

#### Project 5: Simple To-Do List
- **Objective**: Practice using lists and functions.
- **Task**: Create a program that:
  1. Uses a list to store tasks.
  2. Includes functions `add_task(tasks, task)` to add a task and `show_tasks(tasks)` to display all tasks.
  3. Provides a simple menu for user interaction.
- **Example Code**:
  ```python
  tasks = []
  def add_task(tasks, task):
      tasks.append(task)
  def show_tasks(tasks):
      for i, task in enumerate(tasks, 1):
          print(f"{i}. {task}")
  while True:
      action = input("Add task (A), Show tasks (S), or Quit (Q): ").upper()
      if action == 'A':
          task = input("Enter task: ")
          add_task(tasks, task)
      elif action == 'S':
          show_tasks(tasks)
      elif action == 'Q':
          break
  ```
- **Folder**: `project5/`

#### Project 6: Student Grades
- **Objective**: Introduce dictionaries.
- **Task**: Create a program that:
  1. Uses a dictionary to store student names (keys) and grades (values).
  2. Allows adding new students and updating grades via a menu.
- **Example Code**:
  ```python
  grades = {}
  while True:
      action = input("Add student (A), Update grade (U), Show grades (S), Quit (Q): ").upper()
      if action == 'A':
          name = input("Enter student name: ")
          grade = float(input("Enter grade: "))
          grades[name] = grade
      elif action == 'U':
          name = input("Enter student name: ")
          if name in grades:
              grade = float(input("Enter new grade: "))
              grades[name] = grade
      elif action == 'S':
          for name, grade in grades.items():
              print(f"{name}: {grade}")
      elif action == 'Q':
          break
  ```
- **Folder**: `project6/`

#### Project 7: File Handling
- **Objective**: Learn file operations.
- **Task**: Write a program that:
  1. Reads content from an input file (e.g., `input.txt`).
  2. Writes the content to an output file (e.g., `output.txt`), optionally modifying it (e.g., converting to uppercase).
- **Example Code**:
  ```python
  with open('input.txt', 'r') as infile:
      content = infile.read()
  with open('output.txt', 'w') as outfile:
      outfile.write(content.upper())
  print("File has been copied and converted to uppercase.")
  ```
- **Folder**: `project7/` (Create an `input.txt` file in this folder to test)

#### Project 8: Basic OOP
- **Objective**: Understand object-oriented programming.
- **Task**: Create a `BankAccount` class with:
  1. Attributes: `balance`.
  2. Methods: `deposit(amount)` and `withdraw(amount)`.
  3. Test the class with sample transactions.
- **Example Code**:
  ```python
  class BankAccount:
      def __init__(self):
          self.balance = 0
      def deposit(self, amount):
          if amount > 0:
              self.balance += amount
              print(f"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")
      def withdraw(self, amount):
          if amount <= self.balance:
              self.balance -= amount
              print(f"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")
          else:
              print("Insufficient funds!")
  account = BankAccount()
  account.deposit(100)
  account.withdraw(50)
  ```
- **Folder**: `project8/`

---

### 6. Progress Tracking
- **Numbering System**: The sequential numbering (Project 1, Project 2, etc.) tracks your progress through the course.
- **Milestones**: Each completed project demonstrates mastery of the concepts introduced up to that point.
- **Git Commits**: Review your commit history in GitKraken to see your learning journey (e.g., "Completed Project 3: Number Guessing Game").

---

### 7. Next Steps
After completing these eight projects, you’ll have a solid foundation in Python. You can extend the course with additional projects, such as:
- **Project 9**: A Hangman game (combining loops, strings, and lists).
- **Project 10**: A simple text-based adventure game (using functions and OOP).

Alternatively, explore advanced topics like modules, error handling, or libraries (e.g., `tkinter` for GUIs).

---

### Summary
This course leverages your installed tools—Python 3, PyCharm, and GitKraken—to teach Python programming through a series of numbered projects. By organizing projects in a `PythonCourse` directory with subfolders (e.g., `project1/`, `project2/`), using PyCharm to write code, and GitKraken to track progress, you’ll build practical skills step-by-step. Start with Project 1 and work your way up, committing each project to see your growth as a Python programmer!

### Project 11: Inheritance in Bank Accounts
- **Objective**: Learn object-oriented programming (OOP) inheritance by extending an existing class.
- **Task**: Extend the `BankAccount` class from Project 8 to include:
  1. A base class `BankAccount` with basic methods.
  2. Derived classes `SavingsAccount` (adds interest calculation) and `CheckingAccount` (allows overdraft up to a limit).
  3. Test the classes with sample transactions.
- **Example Code**:
  ```python
  class BankAccount:
      def __init__(self):
          self.balance = 0
      def deposit(self, amount):
          if amount > 0:
              self.balance += amount
              return f"Deposited ${amount}. Balance: ${self.balance}"
      def withdraw(self, amount):
          if amount <= self.balance:
              self.balance -= amount
              return f"Withdrew ${amount}. Balance: ${self.balance}"
          return "Insufficient funds!"

  class SavingsAccount(BankAccount):
      def __init__(self):
          super().__init__()
          self.interest_rate = 0.02  # 2% interest
      def add_interest(self):
          interest = self.balance * self.interest_rate
          self.balance += interest
          return f"Added ${interest:.2f} interest. Balance: ${self.balance:.2f}"

  class CheckingAccount(BankAccount):
      def __init__(self):
          super().__init__()
          self.overdraft_limit = 50
      def withdraw(self, amount):
          if amount <= self.balance + self.overdraft_limit:
              self.balance -= amount
              return f"Withdrew ${amount}. Balance: ${self.balance}"
          return "Overdraft limit exceeded!"

  # Test the classes
  savings = SavingsAccount()
  print(savings.deposit(100))
  print(savings.add_interest())
  checking = CheckingAccount()
  print(checking.deposit(20))
  print(checking.withdraw(60))  # Allows overdraft up to $50
  ```

### Project 12: Error Handling
- **Objective**: Introduce exception handling to manage errors gracefully.
- **Task**: Modify the bank account system from Project 11 to:
  1. Raise exceptions for invalid operations (e.g., negative deposits).
  2. Use try-except blocks to handle errors in the main program.
- **Example Code**:
  ```python
  class BankAccount:
      def __init__(self):
          self.balance = 0
      def deposit(self, amount):
          if amount <= 0:
              raise ValueError("Deposit amount must be positive!")
          self.balance += amount
          return f"Deposited ${amount}. Balance: ${self.balance}"
      def withdraw(self, amount):
          if amount <= self.balance:
              self.balance -= amount
              return f"Withdrew ${amount}. Balance: ${self.balance}"
          raise ValueError("Insufficient funds!")

  # Main program with error handling
  account = BankAccount()
  try:
      print(account.deposit(100))
      print(account.withdraw(50))
      print(account.deposit(-10))  # This will raise an exception
  except ValueError as e:
      print(f"Error: {e}")
  try:
      print(account.withdraw(100))  # This will raise an exception
  except ValueError as e:
      print(f"Error: {e}")
  ```

- **Task**: Split the bank account system into:
  1. A module `accounts.py` containing the `BankAccount` class.
  2. A `main.py` file that imports and uses the class.
- **Example Code**:
  - **accounts.py**:
    ```python
    class BankAccount:
        def __init__(self):
            self.balance = 0
        def deposit(self, amount):
            if amount <= 0:
                raise ValueError("Deposit amount must be positive!")
            self.balance += amount
            return f"Deposited ${amount}. Balance: ${self.balance}"
        def withdraw(self, amount):
            if amount <= self.balance:
                self.balance -= amount
                return f"Withdrew ${amount}. Balance: ${self.balance}"
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds!")
    ```
  - **main.py**:
    ```python
    from accounts import BankAccount

    account = BankAccount()
    try:
        print(account.deposit(200))
        print(account.withdraw(150))
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    ```

- **Task**: Enhance the `BankAccount` class to:
  1. Store a transaction history as a list of dictionaries.
  2. Use list comprehensions to analyze transactions (e.g., total deposits).
- **Example Code**:
  ```python
  class BankAccount:
      def __init__(self):
          self.balance = 0
          self.transactions = []
      def deposit(self, amount):
          if amount > 0:
              self.balance += amount
              self.transactions.append({"type": "deposit", "amount": amount})
              return f"Deposited ${amount}"
      def withdraw(self, amount):
          if amount <= self.balance:
              self.balance -= amount
              self.transactions.append({"type": "withdraw", "amount": amount})
              return f"Withdrew ${amount}"
          return "Insufficient funds!"
      def get_total_deposits(self):
          deposits = [t["amount"] for t in self.transactions if t["type"] == "deposit"]
          return sum(deposits)

  # Test the class
  account = BankAccount()
  print(account.deposit(100))
  print(account.withdraw(30))
  print(account.deposit(50))
  print(f"Total deposits: ${account.get_total_deposits()}")
  ```

  import json

  class BankAccount:
      def __init__(self):
          self.balance = 0
          self.transactions = []
      def deposit(self, amount):
          if amount > 0:
              self.balance += amount
              self.transactions.append({"type": "deposit", "amount": amount})
      def save_to_file(self):
          with open("transactions.json", "w") as f:
              json.dump(self.transactions, f)
      def load_from_file(self):
          try:
              with open("transactions.json", "r") as f:
                  self.transactions = json.load(f)
                  self.balance = sum(t["amount"] for t in self.transactions if t["type"] == "deposit")
          except FileNotFoundError:
              self.transactions = []

  # Test the class
  account = BankAccount()
  account.deposit(100)

### Project 20: Contact Book Application
- **Objective**: Combine multiple concepts into a capstone project.
- **Task**: Build a contact book that:
  1. Uses a `Contact` class for OOP.
  2. Stores contacts in a JSON file.
  3. Allows adding, viewing, and searching contacts via a simple menu.
- **Example Code**:
  ```python
  import json

  class Contact:
      def __init__(self, name, phone):
          self.name = name
          self.phone = phone

  class ContactBook:
      def __init__(self):
          self.contacts = []
          self.load_contacts()
      def add_contact(self, name, phone):
          self.contacts.append({"name": name, "phone": phone})
      def show_contacts(self):
          for contact in self.contacts:
              print(f"Name: {contact['name']}, Phone: {contact['phone']}")
      def search_contact(self, name):
          results = [c for c in self.contacts if name.lower() in c["name"].lower()]
          for contact in results:
              print(f"Found: {contact['name']}, {contact['phone']}")
      def save_contacts(self):
          with open("contacts.json", "w") as f:
              json.dump(self.contacts, f)
      def load_contacts(self):
          try:
              with open("contacts.json", "r") as f:
                  self.contacts = json.load(f)
          except FileNotFoundError:
              self.contacts = []

  # Main program
  book = ContactBook()
  while True:
      action = input("Add (A), Show (S), Search (R), Quit (Q): ").upper()
      if action == "A":
          name = input("Enter name: ")
          phone = input("Enter phone: ")
          book.add_contact(name, phone)
      elif action == "S":
          book.show_contacts()
      elif action == "R":
          name = input("Enter name to search: ")
          book.search_contact(name)
      elif action == "Q":
          book.save_contacts()
          break
  ```

### Summary
These projects (11-20) extend the Python course by introducing key concepts like inheritance, error handling, modules, list comprehensions, JSON, GUIs with `tkinter`, polymorphism, generators, regular expressions, and a final integrative project. Each resides in its own subfolder under `PythonCourse/` (e.g., `project11/`), and progress is tracked via GitKraken commits. This sequence ensures a gradual progression from foundational to intermediate Python skills, preparing learners for more advanced topics or real-world applications. Start with Project 11 and enjoy the journey to Python mastery!
