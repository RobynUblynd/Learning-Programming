### Project 11: Inheritance in Bank Accounts
- **Objective**: Learn object-oriented programming (OOP) inheritance by extending an existing class.
- **Task**: Extend the `BankAccount` class from Project 8 to include:
  1. A base class `BankAccount` with basic methods.
  2. Derived classes `SavingsAccount` (adds interest calculation) and `CheckingAccount` (allows overdraft up to a limit).
  3. Test the classes with sample transactions.
