### Project 17: Polymorphism with Shapes
- **Objective**: Understand polymorphism in OOP.
- **Task**: Create a program with:
  1. A base class `Shape` with an `area()` method.
  2. Derived classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` implementing `area()` differently.
  3. A function to compute areas of a list of shapes.
