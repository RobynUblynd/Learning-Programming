#### Project 7: File Handling
- **Objective**: Learn file operations.
- **Task**: Write a program that:
  1. Reads content from an input file (e.g., `input.txt`).
  2. Writes the content to an output file (e.g., `output.txt`), optionally modifying it (e.g., converting to uppercase).


- **Folder**: `project7/` (Create an `input.txt` file in this folder to test)
