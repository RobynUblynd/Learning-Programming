#### Project 3: Number Guessing Game
- **Objective**: Introduce control structures (loops and conditionals).
- **Task**: Implement a game where:
  1. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100 (use `random.randint(1, 100)`).
  2. The user guesses the number, receiving hints like "Too high" or "Too low" until they guess correctly.
