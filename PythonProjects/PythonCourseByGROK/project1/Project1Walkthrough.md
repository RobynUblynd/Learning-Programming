# **Project 1: Hello, World! and Basic Input/Output**

This guide walks you through your first Python project, helping you set up your environment, write a simple program, and save your work. Along the way, you'll learn why each step is important and how it builds your skills as a Python programmer.

---

## **Objective**
- Get comfortable with PyCharm (your coding tool) and basic Python syntax.
- Learn how to:
  - Display text using `print()`.
  - Collect user input with `input()`.
  - Combine text and variables using f-strings.

## **Task**
Write a Python program that:
1. Prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. Prompts the user to enter their name.
3. Displays a personalized greeting, like "Hello, Alice!", using the name provided.

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **Step 1: Set Up Your Environment**
Before coding, you need the right tools—like setting up your desk before starting homework.

- **Python 3**  
  - **What**: The programming language you'll use (version 3 is the current standard).  
  - **How**: Check if it’s installed by opening a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and typing:
    ```
    python3 --version
    ```
    (On Windows, try `python --version`.) Look for output like "Python 3.11.0". If it’s not installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).  
  - **Why**: Ensures you’re using the right version for the course. A mismatch could cause errors, like using an old textbook with outdated info.

- **PyCharm**  
  - **What**: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write, run, and test your code.  
  - **How**: Install it from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) if you haven’t yet. Choose the Community Edition (it’s free).  
  - **Why**: PyCharm makes coding easier with features like auto-suggestions and a "Run" button—like a smart notebook that helps you write and check your work.

- **GitKraken**  
  - **What**: A visual tool for Git, which tracks changes to your code.  
  - **How**: Download it from [GitKraken’s website](https://www.gitkraken.com/).  
  - **Why**: It’s like a save point in a game—Git lets you rewind if you mess up, and GitKraken makes it beginner-friendly.

**Key Takeaway**: A solid setup means you can focus on learning Python instead of fixing technical glitches.

### **Step 2: Create the Project Structure**
Good organization keeps your work manageable—think of it as sorting your school notes into folders.

- **Main Project Directory (`PythonCourse`)**  
  - **What**: A top-level folder for all your course projects.  
  - **How**: In PyCharm, click **File > New Project**, name it `PythonCourse`, pick a location (e.g., your Desktop), and hit **Create**.  
  - **Why**: Centralizes everything, like a binder for all your assignments.

- **Subfolder for Project 1 (`project1/`)**  
  - **What**: A folder just for this project.  
  - **How**: In PyCharm’s Project Explorer (left panel), right-click `PythonCourse`, choose **New > Directory**, and name it `project1`.  
  - **Why**: Separates projects so they don’t get mixed up—like chapters in a book.

- **Python File (`main.py`)**  
  - **What**: The file where your code lives.  
  - **How**: Right-click `project1/`, select **New > Python File**, and name it `main.py`.  
  - **Why**: `main.py` is a common name for the main script—like the title page of your project.

**Your Structure Should Look Like This**:
```
PythonCourse/
└── project1/
    └── main.py
```

**Key Takeaway**: A clear structure now saves time later, especially when projects grow bigger.

---

### **Step 3: Write the Code**
Now, let’s code! Open `main.py` in PyCharm and type this:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Here’s what each line does and why it’s useful:

- **Line 1: `print("Hello, World!")`**  
  - **What**: Shows "Hello, World!" on the screen.  
  - **How**: `print()` sends text to the console (PyCharm’s output area).  
  - **Why**: Tests your setup—if it works, you’re ready to go! It’s also a basic skill for showing results.

- **Line 2: `name = input("Enter your name: ")`**  
  - **What**: Displays "Enter your name: ", waits for the user to type (e.g., "Alice"), and stores it in `name`.  
  - **How**: `input()` handles user interaction; `name` is a variable (a labeled box for data).  
  - **Why**: Makes your program interactive—users can personalize it. Variables are core to programming, letting you reuse data.

- **Line 3: `print(f"Hello, {name}!")`**  
  - **What**: Prints something like "Hello, Alice!" using the user’s input.  
  - **How**: The `f` creates an f-string, inserting `name`’s value into the text.  
  - **Why**: Combines text and variables cleanly. F-strings are a modern, readable way to format output.

**Key Takeaway**: This tiny program teaches output, input, variables, and formatting—building blocks for bigger things.

### **Step 4: Run the Code**
Time to see it work!

- **How to Run**:  
  - In PyCharm, right-click `main.py` in the Project Explorer and pick **Run 'main'**, or hit the green "Play" button (top-right) and choose `main.py`.  
  - Watch the console (bottom of PyCharm):  
    ```
    Hello, World!
    Enter your name: 
    ```
  - Type a name (e.g., "Alice") and press Enter. You’ll see:  
    ```
    Hello, Alice!
    ```

- **Why It’s Important**:  
  - **Verification**: "Hello, World!" proves your environment works; the greeting confirms `input()` and f-strings do too.  
  - **Flow**: Shows how Python runs top-to-bottom—one step at a time.  
  - **Debugging**: If something’s wrong (e.g., a typo), you’ll spot it here.

**Key Takeaway**: Running your code is like testing a recipe—make sure it tastes right before serving!

### **Step 5: Commit Your Changes Using Git**
Save your progress so you can track it or undo mistakes later.

- **Initialize a Git Repository**:  
  - **What**: Starts Git tracking for your project.  
  - **How**: In PyCharm, go to **VCS > Enable Version Control Integration**, pick **Git**, and click **OK**.  
  - **Why**: Sets up a history log for your code—like a diary of your work.

- **Commit Your Work**:  
  - **What**: Saves a snapshot of `main.py`.  
  - **How**: Press `Ctrl + K` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + K` (Mac), or go to **VCS > Commit**. Check `project1/main.py`, write a message like "Completed Project 1: Hello, World! and Input", and click **Commit**.  
  - **Why**: Marks this milestone. If you mess up later, you can revert to this version.

- **Optional: Use GitKraken**:  
  - **What**: A visual Git tool.  
  - **How**: Open GitKraken, select **File > Open Repo**, pick `PythonCourse`, and view your commit as a dot on a timeline.  
  - **Why**: Makes Git easier to understand without commands.

**Key Takeaway**: Commits are like saving a draft—secure your progress and track your growth.

## **What You’ve Learned**
By finishing Project 1, you’ve mastered:
- Setting up and running a Python project in PyCharm.
- Printing text with `print()`.
- Getting user input with `input()`.
- Formatting strings with f-strings.
- Basic Git version control.

These are foundational skills you’ll build on throughout the course.

---

## **Extra Tips to Boost Your Learning**
- **Play Around**: Change the greeting to `print(f"Welcome, {name}!")` and rerun it. See how it feels different?  
- **Expand It**: Add a second `input()` for the user’s age and print it (e.g., "Hello, Alice! You’re 25!").  
- **Be Curious**: Wondering what f-strings are? Look them up or ask—it deepens your understanding.

**Key Takeaway**: Experimenting makes concepts stick and builds confidence.

---

## **Next Steps**
- Start **Project 2: Simple Calculator** to explore variables, data types, and math operations.  
- Follow the course order—each project builds on the last.  
- Keep committing changes after every project to maintain a progress log.

## **The Big Picture**
Here’s what you’ve done in Project 1:
1. **Prepared**: Set up Python, PyCharm, and GitKraken.  
2. **Organized**: Created `PythonCourse/project1/main.py`.  
3. **Coded**: Wrote a program with output, input, and formatting.  
4. **Tested**: Ran it to confirm it works.  
5. **Saved**: Committed it with Git.

**Why It Matters**: You’re not just coding—you’re learning how to think like a programmer with good habits (organization, testing, version control) while grasping Python basics. This sets you up for success as the course ramps up. Ready for Project 2? You’ve got this!
